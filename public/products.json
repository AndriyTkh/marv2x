It operates reliably in dry or wet conditions, including explosive atmospheres (ATEX Zone 1/2), making it ideal for steel production, emission control, and other harsh industrial environments.",

      "At its core is a 3rd generation five-zone optical cell. The central zone holds undiluted sample gas, while surrounding purge zones protect optical windows from dust, moisture, and corrosive condensates. This design prevents fouling, maintains accurate measurements, and allows operation at up to 200 °C and 10 bar. Optical windows are made of durable infrared- and visible-transparent materials for chemical and thermal stability.",

Infrared absorption analyzes gas and moisture, while visible-light forward scattering measures dust concentrations from 0.1 to 300 mg/m³. Sample gas is measured undiluted, with algorithmic compensation ensuring accurate multi-component analysis.",

The MARV Analyzer measures gases from ppm levels to high concentrations (e.g., CO up to 70% vol) while monitoring dust and moisture, providing a robust and precise solution for industrial process monitoring."
